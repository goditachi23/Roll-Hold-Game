# Roll---Hold-Game


 This is a simple roll and hold game in which both players gets a chance-

 Players can roll the dice and can roll any number of times, the score will get added in the current score sections
 But if the dice rolls '1' then the currents score resets to '0' and player 2 will get the chance

 to avoid this players will have option to hold the scores which will convert their current scores to saved/real time scores of the players, but by clicking hold the player passes the turn to other player 

 First player to reach '100' points wins the game.
